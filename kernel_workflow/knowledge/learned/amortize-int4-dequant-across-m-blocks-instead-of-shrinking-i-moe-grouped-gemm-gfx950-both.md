# Amortize int4 dequant across M-blocks instead of shrinking it
- lever: Make one dequantized weight tile serve more MFMA work: fuse several M blocks of the same expert behind one dequant pass, round a short expert tail UP into a padded merge, and express an odd rung as two accumulators (2+1) in one K loop rather than padding to the next power of two; on top of that a magic-number nibble->fp32 conversion that is bit-exact and removes every in-loop int->float convert.
- apply: Load the packed weight tile once as [BK/2, BN] uint8 and split low/high nibbles with constant masks (fold the 0.0625 into the high-nibble scale); dispatch on the host to a merged vs unmerged specialisation by an expanded/valid row ratio; re-sweep BLOCK_SIZE_K, num_warps, num_stages and matrix_instr_nonkdim after every body rewrite.
- stack: total 2.61x isolated (geomean, director-verified) = four groups compounded
  - 1. nibble split + launch re-tile — 1.72x cumulative; the split alone is 1.10x and the re-sweep on the merged body carries it (stacking the two bodies without re-tuning scored only 1.23x)
  - 2. magic-number dequant + nonkdim16 — 1.85x cumulative, bit-exact
  - 3. M-block fusion (+16.2%) and the run-length tail ladder (7.4% total across rungs)
  - 4. shader-engine phase-lock fix (+2.6 to +3.0%) and the 2+1 split rung (+3.0% at M=32768, +1.6% at M=65536)
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order, not independent.
- verify: Expect the MFMA instruction count per output tile to stay identical while VALU drops (-61% at the fusion step) and the output stays bit-exact against the golden; re-time the smallest shape separately, since it gains least.
- pitfall: Two verified wins hand-merged, each keeping its own tuning constants, scored below the better one alone -> tuning metaparams are body-specific and expire on a body rewrite -> resolve every shared constant by re-measurement on the merged body.
- caution: Also verify that a skinny / low-expansion shape is routed to its own specialisation: merging there measured +41% to +271% because that shape wants more workgroups, not less operand traffic.
