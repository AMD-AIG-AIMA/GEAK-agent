key: tiny int32 scatter/fill on gfx950 once the Python launch path is already bypassed - four further host-side axes were measured to the floor and none of them paid
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: four axes closed by measurement: wrapper graph capture/replay lost every case (0.94x at B=64, ~2.2-2.7x costlier per launch than the direct C launcher); side streams 2.1x (back-wait) to 4.9x (both-waits) worse than same-stream; a device-resident argument block cut enqueue yet moved reported time +0.3%; the fixed harness constant is one event record, invariant to iteration count, queue state, arrival rate and stream placement

# Four host-side axes that a dispatch-bound tiny op has already paid for
- lever: spend the round elsewhere unless a probe shows a mechanism different from these four; each was root-caused here rather than merely measured slow.
- apply: if one is re-opened, price the intercept itself rather than enqueue: graph enqueue is cheap and the launch-side latency is what loses; and price a host win against the harness knee (below a few units of host time the reported number stops moving) before investing a direction in it.
- verify: an A-vs-A null in the same comparator, plus a dispatch-count gate; a win that appears only in enqueue counters and not in the reported number has landed under the knee.
- pitfall: a launch-value reduction worked mechanically (enqueue down) yet reported +0.3% -> the whole host win sat below the harness knee -> check where the knee is before optimising further host time.
- pitfall: the same patch regressed the guard-miss path ~3.5x under fresh-metadata calls -> the benchmark reuses objects, so the regression was structurally invisible -> add a fresh-metadata micro-probe.
- caution: also verify the residual constant is candidate-controlled at all before attacking it; and also verify how much device work is left worth chasing - here the remaining device excess was worth ~+0.5% reported, under the acceptance gate.
