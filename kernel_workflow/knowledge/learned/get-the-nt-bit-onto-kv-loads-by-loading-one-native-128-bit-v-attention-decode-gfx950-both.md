# Get the nt bit onto KV loads by loading one native 128-bit vector
- lever: Issue a single non-temporal builtin load on a native 128-bit vector type (a 4-wide int ext_vector) for each KV chunk so the compiler emits one 16-byte global load carrying the nt modifier.
- apply: Loads only, no math change, so oracle parity comes for free; the edit is at the KV fetch site, replacing the multi-scalar 16-byte non-temporal helper.
- verify: Disassemble and confirm the 16-byte global load actually carries the nt modifier, then run the interleaved per-case A/B against the frozen baseline and require every case up, not just the geomean.
- pitfall: A helper whose name says non-temporal produced nothing -> on this arch it re-vectorizes four scalar nt loads and the nt modifier is dropped in the process -> read the emitted ISA rather than the source before concluding the hint does not pay.
- caution: Also verify the KV stream is genuinely read-once with no L2 reuse: on a sibling paged decode kernel the same nt bit flipped sign with streamed-set size (about +7% at one concurrency, about -7% at another), so uniform favorability here is a property of zero reuse.
- source: run paged_attention_ragged-ch16h, 2026-07-29, 16h time-scaling campaign, direction r1_d0 (non-temporal KV loads)
