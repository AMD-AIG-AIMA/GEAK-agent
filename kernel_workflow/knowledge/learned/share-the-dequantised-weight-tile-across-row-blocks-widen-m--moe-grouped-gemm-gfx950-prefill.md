key: dequant-heavy packed-int4 weight GEMM on gfx950, Triton, where the same dequantised weight tile can serve several row-blocks
type: lever
confidence: ★★
effect: +24.4% at fusion width 2 and a further +23.8% widening 2 to 4, both non-overlapping vs frozen baseline; the gain lands on the large-M cases (M=32768/65536), the small-M case (M=2048) stays flat because it is memory-latency bound

# Share the dequantised weight tile across row-blocks, widen M first
- lever: reuse ONE dequantised weight tile across a group of row-blocks so the dequant cost is paid once per group; the dequant tile is shared across M and replicated across N, so widening along M buys more than widening along N at the same product.
- apply: widen the NUMBER of dots at a small row-tile instead of raising the row-tile extent, and concatenate the sub-blocks into one tile-major [BM, MM*BK] activation operand so the LDS round trip plus barrier pair is paid once per k-iteration.
- verify: isolated A/B per shape against the frozen baseline plus bit-exactness against the golden path, and check registers: the widened form held at 124 VGPR / 4 waves, beating a pre-declared register kill gate.
- pitfall: raising the row-tile extent instead of the dot count flipped warpsPerCTA and doubled the dequant work -> measured 0.64x -> keep the tile extent, widen the count.
a width knob that degrades to width 1 on the small shape lost -> degrade to the next-narrower FUSED form instead of unfusing.
- caution: also verify the activation-concat still pays at the widest group - at group width 8 the concat reversed sign and the unconcatenated form won, so re-measure the concat at each width.
