key: paged split-KV decode attention on gfx950 whose small-batch case is parallelism-starved rather than bandwidth-bound, with a launcher already far under the dispatch knee
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: ~1.00x across four probes: locality swizzle 1.5838x against a 1.5919x round entry despite batch=2 L2 hit 16.9%->66.7% and DRAM amplification 2.45x->0.98x; full-op graph capture 1.5777x with eager-vs-replay 0.740/0.789/0.801x per case; thin launcher alone 1.003x

description: Cache-locality swizzle and host/graph-capture levers both returned ~1.00x on a decode attention op that was neither bandwidth- nor dispatch-bound.

# Positive cache counters and a cheaper launcher can both buy zero clock
- lever: Classify each shape first - its fraction of achievable DRAM read rate, and its per-call host cost against the measured dispatch knee - and treat cache placement and host/dispatch as candidates only for shapes that classification says are actually held there.
- apply: Both probes are cheap: a program-id swizzle that lands sibling programs on one L2 slice, and full-op graph capture with an allocation-free fast path. Run them as probes and gate promotion on the frozen-baseline clock rather than on the counter they move.
- verify: Pair every counter improvement with an isolated A/B on the same shape; a hit-rate or amplification improvement that leaves the clock inside the noise band is a closed axis, not a partial win.
- pitfall: Counters moved hugely (L2 hit ~4x, amplification to ~1.0) while the clock stayed flat -> the small-batch case was parallelism-starved at a quarter of CU fill, not bandwidth-bound -> the round was better spent on grid shape.
Graph capture measured slower than eager -> the launcher already sat ~4x under the dispatch knee and the residual gap was the benchmark's own barrier packets, paid identically by the baseline -> compare per-call host cost to the knee before staffing this lane.
- caution: Both dead-end directions were still merged at zero measured cost for robustness (safe stream handling, kwargs guard) - also verify whether a clock-neutral direction is worth keeping for safety before discarding it.
