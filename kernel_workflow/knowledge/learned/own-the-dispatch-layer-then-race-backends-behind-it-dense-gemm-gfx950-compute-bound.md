# Own the dispatch layer, then race backends behind it
- lever: When the editable file owns the launcher, treat the frozen launch config as the defect first, then reuse that shim as a per-shape backend selector (in-tree kernel / hand-authored HIP / tuned vendor library) chosen by measured argmin, not by reasoning.
- apply: Replace the fixed grid with a real tile (256x256x64, 16 warps, 3 stages, tuned GROUP_SIZE_M); JIT extra backends from the same file via cpp_extension load_inline; freeze per-shape vendor algo indices from an exhaustive solution sweep; cache plans keyed by shape+algo+pointer; fuse bias into the library epilogue for a single copy-free dispatch; keep named fallback tiers.
- stack: total 4.05x director-verified geomean = three directions compounded, each landing at the shim
  - 1. tile/launch-config escape - 2.78x standalone (round 1, verified) - the whole cumulative for four rounds and the enabler of the rest
  - 2. hand-authored HIP kernel, same tile/waves/MFMA - +21% on top of (1) (round 5, verified) - isolates codegen, not algorithm, as the wall
  - 3. tuned vendor-library backend - +17% on top of (1,2) (round 7, verified) - largest single win
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order; (2) and (3) are mutually exclusive backends, so (3) alone over (1) is roughly the product of the two.
- verify: Paired golden-vs-candidate A/B inside one process, repeated invocations; confirm the intended tier actually engaged (one-shot named warning on every fallback transition, strict env flag to make them fatal) - otherwise a build failure reads as 'the fast path was chosen'.
- pitfall: A shared build cache served a stale artifact so the old binary was timed -> validate any new instrument against a known-good reference dispatch before trusting one number from it.
An in-process sweep reported a zero duration for every algo while parity showed cos 1.000000 -> the timer, not the kernels, was broken.
- caution: Frozen algo indices are card- and library-version specific; also verify they still resolve on your build - an unresolved index degrades to the framework path silently, correct but roughly 5% slower, and shapes outside the frozen table lose ~1.11x at the smallest M.
