key: tiny int64 index-scatter memory-movement op on gfx950, Triton launched from Python, where host dispatch dominates the measured window

# Raw driver launch for a dispatch-bound copy op
- lever: When the measured window is mostly host submit, call the already-compiled module through a raw ctypes driver launch instead of the framework's Python launch wrapper.
- apply: Cache the compiled binary and a ctypes kernelParams buffer packed once at setup; per call, do one driver launch with a fixed grid, no argument re-marshalling and no autotuner/hook re-entry.
- verify: Check the grid and bit-exact integer output against the golden reference, then confirm the gain is roughly flat across batch cases - a per-call constant, not a shape effect.
- pitfall: graph capture/replay looked like the answer and returned only ~1.32x -> replay still pays the Python bracket around it -> the raw module launch on the same seed reached 2.61x and superseded it.
- caution: The win is bounded by the timing bracket itself; also verify what fraction of the measured window an empty launch already costs before attributing more headroom to further host work.
