# Sub-K coarsening: regroup the same reduction order into fewer wider dots
- lever: Sweep the inner sub-K split (SUB_K a multiple of the MFMA K, so only a few values are legal) while keeping ONE linear fp32 accumulator: it regroups the identical summation order, so a bit-exact parity gate stays satisfied.
- apply: One-line config change to the sub-K factor; the coarser split halves per-K-block convert / repack / transpose invocations and lets the compiler overlap load+convert+LDS against the MFMA chain.
- verify: Confirm max_rel=0 against golden, then re-time on the frozen isolated A/B; check VGPR count and occupancy in the AMDGCN ISA to see the coarser tile did not spill.
- pitfall: Too-coarse a split (below the legal midpoint) spills VGPRs and regresses -> register pressure, not issue rate, is the limit -> keep the measured optimum and re-sweep after any convert-path rewrite, since the optimum moved by one step once the packed-convert path landed.
- caution: The win is critical-path balance, not op count, so also verify it holds when the auto-pipeliner stage count changes; on a shape with a different K it can shift.
