# Pick the pipeline variant per stage, then shrink the CShuffle cluster
- lever: The two grouped-GEMM stages of an MoE layer want different instance shapes: routing the narrow-N down-proj stage from the wide V3 pipeline to the V1 256x64 instance buys a 32x32 MFMA there, and a second, cheap pass shrinking the CShuffle per-shuffle M-cluster to one XDL per wave pays on top of it.
- apply: Emit the alternate instance from the generator script the vendor stack already ships (the hand-written instance lists are frozen and not editable); set the stage-2 route to the V1 bm64 instance for all expert buckets, then set MXDLPerWave to 1 in the CShuffle epilogue of both stages.
- stack: total ~1.29x weighted isolated (director-validated) = four directions compounded
  - 1. stage-2 pipeline variant V3->V1, 32x32 MFMA — 1.27x standalone, carries essentially the whole win
  - 2. CShuffle store vector width 2->8 on stage 1 — +0.35% on top of (1)
  - 3. host-side scale-transpose + routing-metadata cache — +0.27% on top of (1,2), and only on the smallest batch case
  - 4. CShuffle M-cluster MXDLPerWave->1, bit-exact — +1.01% on top of (1,2,3)
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order, not independent.
- verify: Re-time against the pinned frozen baseline on every batch case, not just the largest — (3) moved only the smallest one; confirm the new instance actually got selected by disassembling and checking the MFMA shape changed, since a mis-routed bucket silently falls back to the old instance and still passes parity.
- pitfall: A stage-level tile/route change looked like a global win but only paid on one stage → the two stages have different N extents → route per stage and re-measure each; the per-stage M-tile split that this suggests is structurally impossible in this pipeline and returned 1.00x.
- caution: Also verify the epilogue change is bit-exact against the oracle before crediting it: the cluster shrink was, but the wider store width in (2) changes the write pattern and deserves its own parity check.
