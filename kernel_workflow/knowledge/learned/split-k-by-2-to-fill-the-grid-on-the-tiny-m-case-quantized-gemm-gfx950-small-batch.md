key: smallest-M shape of a block-scaled fp8 (a8w8) Triton GEMM on gfx950/MI355X, where the grid underfills the device rather than the body being slow
type: lever
confidence: ★★
effect: the tiny-M case ends at 24.3x, slightly ahead of the 23.8x/23.9x of the two larger per-case shapes it used to trail; split-K depth 3 and 4 measured worse than 2 on that same case, and a narrowed N tile came out ~11% slower there

# Split K by 2 to fill the grid on the tiny-M case
- lever: When the small-M shape launches roughly one CTA per CU, split K by 2: CTA count doubles, the per-CTA K loop halves (48->24 iterations here), and the best body config inverts toward fewer warps and more stages.
- apply: Add a split-K axis plus a fused low-precision reduction over the partials; a torch.sum-style multi-kernel reduce costs more than the split gains.
- verify: Re-time the small-M case alone against the frozen baseline (the larger shapes are unaffected), and re-tune warps/stages after splitting rather than carrying the pre-split config over.
- pitfall: Deeper splits regressed — depth 3 and 4 lost to 2 on the tiny case, because the extra reduction work stops amortizing once the per-CTA K loop is already short.
- caution: Also verify the launch grid is recomputed when tile sizes are overridden: one config's non-split grid formula was not, so a tile-size sweep measures the wrong geometry.
