key: resolving effects of a couple of percent on a short-running Triton op, where a 3-case geomean dilutes a real per-case device saving
type: method
confidence: ★★
effect: resolved a real, bit-exact per-case effect of +1.37% and +1.29% at 92% sign consistency over 62 paired reps; the control arm moved the same case +0.87% and +4.38% monotonically with injected identity work and flipped the geomean -1.46%

# Per-rep geomean plus a two-sided negative control
- lever: compute the geomean per rep and keep the distribution, rather than pooling the min across reps into a single number.
- apply: paired interleaved A/B over tens of reps; report the median paired ratio and the sign consistency; fix the acceptance bar before the first measurement.
- verify: add a two-sided negative control - inject provably output-neutral work at two magnitudes and confirm the wall clock moves monotonically in the expected direction; a small positive is credible once the harness has been shown to resolve that magnitude both ways.
- pitfall: the pooled-min A/B emitted one number per candidate -> sign consistency and the paired ratio distribution were unobservable -> a genuine ~1.3% effect could be neither certified nor declined, and an unbounded tail of rounds looked justified.
- caution: also verify a certified-real effect against the bar stated in advance; here a real bit-exact +1.3% fell under a +1.5% bar, and declining it is what let the campaign terminate defensibly.
