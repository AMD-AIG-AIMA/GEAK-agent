# Per-M-bucket launch config on an int4 weight-only grouped GEMM
- lever: When the kernel body is M-independent (cost dominated by int4 dequant per output tile), stop tuning one global launch config and pick a separate config per M bucket: tile M x N, BLOCK_K, group-size-M, num_warps, num_stages.
- apply: Host/wrapper-only edit: bucket M at dispatch and select a per-bucket config dict; the compiled kernel source can stay byte-identical to the golden, which keeps parity risk near zero.
- stack: total 3.33x cumulative = two non-overlapping host-side patches. 1. per-M-bucket config retune - 3.26x standalone (verified), carries essentially the whole win. 2. second host patch integrated on top - 3.31x (verified), i.e. a small increment. Attribution is incremental in landing order; 12 later kernel-side directions added exactly 0.
- verify: Frozen-baseline isolated A/B per case (not just the geomean) plus oracle parity on every case; confirm each bucket actually resolves to its own config, since a single mis-bucketed dispatch hides the whole effect.
- pitfall: Buckets disagreed on group-size-M (small-M kept a larger value than the big cases) -> a single global config underserves one end of the M range -> tune each bucket independently rather than averaging.
- caution: An algorithmic variant that de-interleaves the packed weights to drop a K-reorder shuffle measured only ~1.03x and was incompatible with the winning large tile - also verify a body-level idea composes with the incumbent tile before spending a round on it.
- source: run fused_moe_int4_w4a16-ch16h (16h per-kernel time-budget campaign, 2026-07-28/29), 49 resumed passes
