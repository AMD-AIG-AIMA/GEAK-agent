key: isolated A/B methodology when the graded case set mixes launch-floor tiny cases with heavy long-context ones, gfx950 attention campaign
type: method
confidence: ★★
effect: same direction measured +2.5% on the heavy-only subset and +0.3% in the graded full mix; two same-session A/B pairs over the tiny cases disagreed 1.107x vs 0.993x, and a baseline-only control of the unchanged path came out ahead of the candidate, so a projected +5.5% on those cases resolved to 0.988x

# A/B in the graded case mix, and price a direction against the noise floor first
- lever: Run each candidate A/B in the same case mix and same session as the graded number, and treat launch-floor cases as a noise channel rather than as recoverable geomean.
- apply: Before assigning a direction whose upside lives in the small cases, compare its projected gain to the observed session-to-session spread at the launch floor (~20% here); a projection below that spread is unmeasurable, however sound the mechanism.
- verify: Add a baseline-only control pair inside the same session — if the unchanged path comes out ahead of the candidate, what you measured is session/clock state rather than the kernel.
- pitfall: a self-consistent gain on a heavy-only subset evaporated when graded -> running only heavy shapes holds a different sustained clock/thermal state than interleaving them with tiny ones -> re-measure in the graded mix before reporting.
a correctness-safe, well-founded host-side size-gate still landed below 1.0 -> its premise came from comparing two different sessions -> settle the premise with a same-session pair before spending a round building the gate.
- caution: Here the heavy-case baseline was stable run-to-run (<0.1%) while the tiny-case one was not; also verify which half of your own case set is stable before attributing a small delta to a candidate.
