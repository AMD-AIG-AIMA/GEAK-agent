key: ceiling diagnosis for a dequant-bound int4 weight-only MoE grouped GEMM on gfx950 sitting at 2 waves behind a mandatory fp32 accumulator tile
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: 10 consecutive directions returned exactly 1.000x per-case (cumulative frozen at 3.33x across all three cases); regressions where they moved: num_warps=4 up to 6.5x worse, MFMA nonkdim 32 +18.4% on the small-M case and +1.2%/+1.7% on the larger ones, bf16 dequant intermediate 3.33x->2.95x, host graph replay 0.985x, hand-scheduled MFMA rewrite 7-13x slower

# Axes that closed on a dequant-latency-bound quantized grouped GEMM
- lever: Give these a low prior once the body is dequant-VALU/dependency-latency bound: MFMA nonkdim x kpack, num_warps, BLOCK_K x num_stages, split-K, a narrower dequant intermediate dtype, lop3/bitcast dequant tricks, host-side graph capture, and full kernel rewrites - each was swept here and none beat the tuned host config.
- apply: Cheap discriminators first: compare host enqueue against per-call GPU time (dispatch was ~1/14 of it, so graph capture cannot pay), and check whether the accumulator tile already pins occupancy before treating occupancy as the lever.
- verify: Every combination stayed bit-correct against the oracle, so these are pure perf outcomes; re-measure per M bucket rather than on the geomean, since one bucket can hide another's regression.
- pitfall: Bitcast dequant cut VALU and convert op counts substantially yet the two large cases got ~7% slower -> the wall is dependency latency plus VGPR pressure (fp32 accumulator at the register limit, 2 waves), not issue throughput -> reducing op count alone does not move it.
- caution: Forcing a third wave by shrinking tile N made the mid case worse, and a 16x16->32x32 MFMA win imported from a sibling MoE kernel did not transfer - also verify the wall class on your own tile and accumulator dtype before reusing this list, which was measured on one large fp32-accumulator tile.
