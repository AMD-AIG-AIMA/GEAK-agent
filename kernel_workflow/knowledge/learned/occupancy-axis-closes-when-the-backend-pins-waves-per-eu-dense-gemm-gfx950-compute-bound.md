key: occupancy and wave-count tuning on an MFMA-bound fp16 dense GEMM whose compiler pins waves-per-eu, gfx950 CDNA4
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: ~1.00x on four occupancy-directed attempts (COARSEN=3, 32x32 MFMA, tile shrink, intra-workgroup ping-pong) and clearly negative on two more: the 8-wave workgroup costs about 80% and the waves-per-eu=1 register double-buffer is ~50% slower, on every case (small-M and large-M alike)

# Occupancy axis closes when the backend pins waves-per-eu
- lever: Before budgeting rounds on occupancy for an MFMA-bound GEMM, check whether the AMD backend emits an unconditional amdgpu-waves-per-eu attribute at the end of LLIR generation; if it does, no in-body primitive raises occupancy and the whole axis can be probed with one cheap test instead of four rounds.
- apply: Two knobs that look alike behave differently: waves-per-eu is frozen from inside the kernel body, while num_warps is only a harness default and a launcher-side override can force 8 — so test them separately rather than concluding both are frozen.
- verify: Compare achieved workgroups-per-CU, not just the launch config: a variant that changes the wave count without changing workgroups-per-CU has not engaged, and re-time per case against the frozen baseline.
- pitfall: the 8-wave ping-pong schedule from a published recipe looked like free throughput -> it collapses 2 workgroups/CU to 1 and loses the inter-tile overlap that hides load latency on this low-intensity shape -> the 4-wave, occupancy-2 configuration wins; the intra-workgroup variant additionally corrupted the accumulator.
- caution: also verify the shape regime the published ping-pong result was measured on — that number comes from a large square high-K GEMM, and its own write-up scopes ping-pong out of skinny / low-K shapes like this one.
