key: multi-XCD CDNA4 (gfx950) grouped GEMM whose expert-weight operand is re-read across workgroups — the grid-to-L2-slice mapping, not the inner loop
type: lever
confidence: ★★
effect: largest single item of the campaign: first-stage HBM read traffic -47% at 2048 tokens and -67% at 65536, carrying the cumulative from 1.29x to 1.35x; a later per-grid-size chunk adds +0.9% more, with the mid case monotone in chunk size (-0% / -1.9% / -2.4% for 24 / 384 / 816)

# Invert the XCD round-robin with a chunk-interleaved workgroup remap
- lever: the hardware distributes workgroups across XCDs on the LINEAR id, so tiles sharing an operand scatter; remap the id in chunks so a run of tiles sharing weights lands on one XCD's L2 slice.
- apply: index remap inside the gridwise header, gated on exact divisibility (total % (NumXcd*Chunk) == 0) with a fallback to the stock mapping; the logical XCD count that won was half the physical one, and the chunk value itself is the tuned quantity.
- verify: enumerate the remap host-side and prove it is a bijection before it is allowed to be timed; then confirm the HBM read counter drops, and swap prebuilt modules in place so an arm is never confounded with a build.
- pitfall: a remap looked ~12% faster -> the id formula was not a bijection and silently dropped 2 of 12 tiles at one N extent -> full-speed wrong answer that a speed-only A/B accepts; bijection proof first.
one global chunk value scored neutral for ten rounds -> the optimum tracks grid size, and the best mid-case value costs +8.2% at the small case -> express the chunk as a function of grid size.
- caution: also verify the reuse you are targeting is contiguous in the remapped id — a second-stage operand strided by n-block is structurally unreachable by the same swizzle, and that stage's grid order was pinned by its epilogue's row addressing.
- source: run kernel_20_geak_0808_16h, 2026-08-08..09, gfx950/MI355X; 10-cycle interleaved paired A/B, correctness PASS per arm
