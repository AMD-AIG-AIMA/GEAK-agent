# Software-emulated fp8 cast: find it by differential recompile, kill it with the native convert
- lever: when an elementwise cast shows a ~200:1 VALU:memory instruction ratio, suspect the dtype is emulated; emit the hardware's own packed convert and bitcast into the target flavour (biases differing by a constant are bit-exact over the clamped range), then fix -0 in the fp32 domain
- apply: differential recompile: change ONLY the output dtype to the hardware-native twin and diff the ISA VALU count (852 -> 290 here); that delta is the emulation, and it is the size of the available win
- stack: total 3.73x geomean isolated, drift-free interleaved (per case 2.93x / 4.47x / 3.95x) = four directions compounded
  - 1. coarsening: G groups per program, 2-D tile, dwordx4 loads, num_warps=1 — 1.60x standalone (round 1, verified); fewer warps won monotonically
  - 2. native convert + bitcast (this card) — 1.60x -> 2.66x cumulative (round 2, verified) — the largest single step
  - 3. exact reciprocal + prebound host dispatch, textually disjoint — 2.66x -> 4.12x cumulative (round 3, both verified)
  - 4. geometry-gated packed multiply and a short reciprocal at small tiles — ~+2% (rounds 7-8, verified)
  - note: 1-4 are cumulative against the FROZEN baseline table, which carried ~1.13x of box drift; the 3.73x total is the drift-free re-measure, so the parts do not multiply to it
- verify: paired interleaved A/B inside one GPU lock — candidate, incumbent HEAD and a byte-identical null as separate processes from their own directories, randomized order, min AND median, 2-4 windows
- pitfall: two plain-Triton reformulations passed the harness correctness cases yet were wrong on 8 of 94 NaN/eps configs (including all-zeros with eps=0) -> a clamp lowers to a med3 instruction that maps NaN to a number while the hardware convert maps it to the max code -> keep the med3 in the chain and sweep NaN / +-0 / eps separately
frozen-denominator scoring handed out ~1.13x of free geomean -> the frozen table was 17-21% slower than a same-day remeasure on two of three cases -> score every candidate against an incumbent measured in the same window
- caution: also verify which -0 fixup form is cheapest on your target: abs as a free source modifier measured below the maximum, byte-mask and xor forms here, and the ordering may differ elsewhere
