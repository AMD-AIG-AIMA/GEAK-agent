key: host binding hit-path caching for a bf16 skinny GEMV decode linear on gfx950 where per-call host work is a large share of the wall
type: lever
confidence: ★★
effect: ~1.08-1.10x same-session geomean across the three decode cases (tokens=2 and 4) from allocation reuse plus a lock-free last-hit shortcut, collapsing a host share that was ~45% of the per-call wall; every device-side direction in the same run returned ~1.00x

# Cache the per-call host work when the host owns a large share of a tiny op's wall
- lever: reuse allocations across calls and add a thread_local last-hit shortcut that skips the mutex and the table scan on the binding hit path
- apply: in the C++ binding: compare the cached last-hit descriptor before taking the lock, fall through to the locked lookup on a miss; the device kernel is untouched
- verify: confirm the dispatch count is unchanged so the gain is provably host-side, then run a same-session interleaved A/B per case against the raw unwrapped frozen baseline
- pitfall: the cumulative-vs-frozen number jumped from ~1.10x to ~1.31x with no new patch -> box timing drift between sessions, not an optimization -> re-A/B in one session before crediting any cumulative delta
- caution: also verify there is host work left to remove: trimming further integer compares and branches off the same hit path measured +-3-4%, inside the ~8% within-config spread, i.e. measured-closed rather than helpful
