key: int4 W4A16 packed-weight fused-MoE grouped GEMM on gfx950/MI355, Triton + immutable host, several n-width shape arms in one launch
type: lever
confidence: ★★
effect: the shared-binary control (one kernel, runtime branch) is 4.9% slower on the small-M arm (M=2048) than two specialized entries; per-arm launch constants that only the shim can set add +3.0-3.4% on M=32768/65536, all non-overlapping vs frozen baseline

description: Split an int4 W4A16 MoE grouped GEMM into per-n-width Triton entries picked by a host launcher shim; the shim then owns each arm's launch constants.

# One binary per shape arm, selected by a host launcher shim
- lever: give each n-width shape arm its own @triton.jit entry chosen on the host, rather than one kernel with a runtime branch: VGPR allocation and I-cache footprint are whole-binary properties, so a shared binary taxes whichever arm takes the narrow path.
- apply: a thin launcher shim in front of the (often immutable) host call selects the entry and owns the launch kwargs dict per arm - num_warps, waves_per_eu, loop_unroll_factor - so each arm is tuned against its own codegen.
- stack: total 2.80x geomean isolated (director-verified, accepted), many directions over 24 rounds, incremental in landing order
  - 1. per-arm split entries + shim-owned launch constants - the enabling mechanism; shared-binary control 4.9% slower on the small-M arm, launch-constant pair +3.0-3.4% on top
  - 2. dequant-tile fusion width (see the fusion-width card) - +24.4% then a further +23.8%
  - 3. K-loop schedule: single-stage tl.range + per-arm unroll factor - ~18-20% on the large-M cases
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order, not independent; directions interact.
- verify: A/B each arm interleaved against a byte-identical control binary, and confirm the arm predicate engaged by diffing the generated AMDGCN - an unrecognised launch option is silently swallowed, so absence of an error proves nothing.
- pitfall: a constant that applied cleanly across arms read as compatible -> a tuning constant belongs to the codegen it was tuned against -> re-tune per arm, and sweep the pair jointly (num_warps and waves_per_eu both had to move DOWN together; no one-axis sweep finds that point).
a widened arm printed 1.6-1.8x while skipping work -> the perf path printed a ratio with no correctness binding -> gate any ratio above ~1.2 behind an md5-bound correctness token at print time.
- caution: also verify the shared-binary control is measured on the same session, since the split only pays once the narrow arm stops carrying the wide arm's register budget.
