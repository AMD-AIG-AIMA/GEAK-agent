key: measuring single-dispatch tiny ops on gfx950 where the timing harness itself, not the kernel, owns most of the reported number
type: method
confidence: ★★
effect: a graph-replay probe overstated reported impact ~4x and inverted small signs (replay spread across cases 3x the harness spread); an unrotated interleaved comparator read the first slot slow on an identical body and manufactured a ~14% fake win; inside the plateau band, added device work is discounted ~4x (transfer function 2.10 / 2.10 / 2.08 / 2.07 across 4x growing device work, breakout only at 16x)

# Measure a tiny op with the harness's own protocol, rotated, against an A/A null
- lever: build the probe around one dispatch sandwiched between the harness's own barrier packets, rotate variant position every round, and carry an identical-body A/A pair plus an exact-equality parity gate in every generation.
- apply: replace throughput-style replay loops with the single-dispatch protocol; derive a transfer function first by sweeping a synthetic in-window kernel from empty dispatch upward, so you know whether your op sits in the discount plateau or past its breakout.
- verify: the A/A null should read within a few tenths of a percent; a first-slot bias on an identical body means the rig is not rotated yet, and any candidate delta smaller than that null is not a result.
- pitfall: replay-based probe disagreed with the harness in magnitude and sometimes in sign -> replay measures dispatch throughput and hides exposed latency -> re-time with the single-dispatch protocol.
- pitfall: two of three probe generations manufactured a win before the third was right -> unrotated slot bias -> rotate positions and publish the A/A null alongside every number.
- pitfall: a byte-identical artifact re-measured 2.53x in one session and 2.60x in another -> box drift across sessions -> bound what any sub-5% claim can mean, or re-measure both arms in one session.
- caution: also verify where the op sits on that transfer function before calling a device direction dead: inside the plateau a real device win is discounted several-fold before it reaches the reported number, and outside it the same win reads clean.
