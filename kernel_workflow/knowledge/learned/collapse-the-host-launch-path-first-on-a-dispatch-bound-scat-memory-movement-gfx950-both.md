key: int32 request-to-slot scatter/fill in sglang, tiny grid on gfx950 - reported latency is flat across 32x the work, so the Python launch path and not the device code sets the price

# Collapse the host launch path first on a dispatch-bound scatter, then re-grid
- lever: cache a direct-launch dispatch object that skips the JIT wrapper and the Python launcher down to the compiled C launch entry (raw int pointers, no launch metadata), then re-grid the device side so the machine actually fills.
- apply: in the Python wrapper beside the kernel: build the handle once, arm an identity-checked hot path with a pre-built launch tuple and a C-level __getitem__; on the device side replace an O(pid) serial prefix-sum with one masked vector load plus a reduction, and expand the grid to batch*CHUNKS grid-strided column tiles, CHUNKS an additive tl.constexpr whose default reproduces golden semantics.
- stack: total 2.53x director-verified geomean = four directions compounded
  - 1. cached direct-launch dispatch object (round 1, verified) - 2.30x standalone, the dominant lever; host enqueue down ~3.2x, to ~1.01x of a predicted raw-C floor
  - 2. serial prefix-sum removed + re-grid (round 1, merged) - 2.33x cumulative; unmeasurable alone (a throwaway host pedestal hid all device time), confirmed by counters instead
  - 3. identity-armed hot path + pre-built launch tuple + C-level __getitem__ (round 2, verified) - 2.41x cumulative, +5.0-5.8% with an A-vs-A null of 0.2%
  - 4. write-through store modifier on the write-once output + invariant prefix test hoisted out of the column loop (round 3, verified) - 2.53x cumulative, device time down ~1.03-1.10x
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order, not independent.
- verify: paired interleaved A/B against the frozen baseline plus a dispatch-count gate (candidate dispatch count equal to baseline) so no launch is elided or memoized away, and exact-equality parity against golden.
- pitfall: a correct device rewrite measured ~1.00x standalone -> the un-bypassed host path hid all device time -> re-issue device candidates after the launch bypass lands and cross-check with counters (VMEM per wave, workgroup count).
- pitfall: a fast-path guard that drops the ROCm large-storage descriptor check buys speed by risking silent corruption -> keep that check inside the guard; the same hot path also turns an unhashable (list) grid into a TypeError.
- caution: also verify the guard-miss path under fresh per-call metadata objects, which is what the framework does in production: here it ran ~3.5x slower than baseline while the benchmark, reusing objects, could not see it.
- caution: also verify the sign of a cache modifier on this arch - the streaming variant cost +8-13% where write-through gained.
