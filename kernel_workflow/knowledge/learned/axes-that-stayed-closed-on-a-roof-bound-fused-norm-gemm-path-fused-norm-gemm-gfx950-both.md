key: the late rounds of a bf16 fused norm+GEMM campaign on gfx950/MI355 whose prefill arm is at the HBM read roof and whose decode arm is at the graph-dispatch floor
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: disconfirming, all isolated against the frozen baseline: MFMA on the prefill inner phase is bounded by the measured L2 read roof at its 2.15 MB working set to a whole-direction ceiling below the incumbent; cutting 21% of prefill phase-1 instructions moved runtime 0.0%; halving the chunk costs 3.7-19% before any mechanism runs; a double buffer +38%; wave specialisation +5.5%; non-temporal loads +5.3% on the largest prefill case; guard-free block_m>1 on decode hits a register cliff and occupancy 6 measures ~2x slower than the prediction; a CU-aligned decode grid -2.04% +/- 0.41% SEM with sign count 0/10 on one decode case and null on the other

# Axes that stayed closed on a roof-bound fused norm-GEMM path
- lever: Before funding a structural round on an arm already near a roof, price the ceiling: measure bandwidth elasticity (perturb traffic and read the runtime response) and delete the candidate work entirely to get a free upper bound; here elasticity measured ~0.1, so the gap above the byte floor was never serialisation and every overlap/skew/double-buffer variant was paying for a cure to a bound the op does not have.
- apply: Get the bound from a deletion control rather than from a percent-of-roof figure: emptying the whole decode workgroup body left the residual chain intact and flat across a 7x change in workgroup count, which identifies it as a fixed dispatch/drain cost and caps any intra-kernel win at a few percent weighted.
- verify: Gate each of these on a same-process interleaved paired A/B with a per-rep sign count and a stated error bar; the wave-quantization result was a clean unanimous negative rather than the expected null, and only the paired form could show that.
- pitfall: A grid-shape hypothesis looked like it needed a new mechanism -> an existing flag already expressed exactly the shape under test -> flipping the flag off against a control pinned to production settled it in one probe, and showed the fractional tail wave is a purchase, not a cost, because the extra workgroups take the iterative normalisation off the critical path.
- caution: Also verify the non-temporal axis by form before closing it: the loads regressed, while a one-line traversal reversal delivered the cache residency the hint was meant to buy, and stores on write-once outputs were the only surviving form.
