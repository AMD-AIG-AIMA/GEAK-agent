# Pad the epilogue LDS row stride off the 32-bank period
- lever: When an LDS staging tile's row stride is congruent to 0 mod the 32-bank period, every row starts on bank 0; add one pad element to the row so consecutive rows land on different banks.
- apply: Bump the row-length constant in the LDS descriptor of the shuffle/epilogue tile (a 32x128 f32 tile becomes 32x132) and widen the max() that sizes the group segment so the enlarged region actually fits; any nonzero pad mod 32 works, which shows the wide ds_write is decomposed into dword phases.
- verify: Read the bank-conflict / index-active counter ratio before and after, confirm the index-active count itself falls (a ratio alone can be an artifact), and check instruction mix, registers and occupancy are bit-identical so the phase change is the only variable; run a negative control with a pad congruent to the original phase but a larger allocation - if that control also wins you measured a size effect, not bank phase.
- pitfall: The enlarged tile silently did not fit and correctness failed on three earlier pad arms -> the group-segment size was clamped by a max() that was never updated -> widen the sizing expression together with the stride.
The axis looked closed for 22 rounds because it had only ever been probed by latency -> the bank counter had never been read once -> read the counter before declaring an LDS axis closed.
- caution: Counter-to-time is not linear: a follow-up took the same counter a further -89% for only 0.29% of wide-tile time, so also verify the residual conflict is on the critical path before spending another round on it.
