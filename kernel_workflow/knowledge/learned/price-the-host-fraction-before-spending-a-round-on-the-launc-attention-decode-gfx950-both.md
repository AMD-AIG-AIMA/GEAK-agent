key: launch and host-side overhead on a paged attention kernel on gfx950 whose per-call GPU work is several times the host plus two-dispatch cost
type: anti-pattern
confidence: ★★
effect: closed axis over two directions: wrapper graph capture 0.986x weighted geomean (net regression - helps one short decode-shaped case about +3% and costs about 2% on the seven others), host memoization 1.009x, inside the harness noise band

# Price the host fraction before spending a round on the launch floor
- lever: Before planning a launch-overhead round, express per-call GPU work as a multiple of host plus dispatch cost; here GPU work was several times larger, and both host-side directions returned about 1.00x even though each was implemented correctly.
- apply: Capture both launches of the split-KV pair into one graph at the wrapper level (not the launcher) and replay it; separately, memoize the per-call host marshalling.
- verify: Require graph-off to reproduce the baseline exactly so the capture is not the variable, then ask whether the metric window (per-call GPU events) can see host time at all before believing either sign.
- pitfall: Capture was real and correct and collapsed both dispatches, yet geomean fell below 1 -> the async queue already hides host and dispatch cost behind GPU work, and a GPU-event window measures none of it -> measure the host fraction first.
A per-shape never-regress gate was added to rescue it -> the true replay-vs-eager delta of about 1-2% sits under the harness noise band of about 1.2% -> when a lever's true delta is below the noise floor, no per-shape selection gate converts it into a reliable win.
- caution: Also verify whether the wrapper allocates per call: a sibling paged decode kernel whose wrapper did gained a large multi-x win from caching those allocations, so 'the host is invisible' is conditioned on there being no wrapper-side allocation to remove.
