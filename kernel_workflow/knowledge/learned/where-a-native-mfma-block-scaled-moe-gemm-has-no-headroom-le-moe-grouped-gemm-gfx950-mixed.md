# Where a native-MFMA block-scaled MoE GEMM has no headroom left
- lever: When the disassembly shows the native f8f6f4 MFMA is already being emitted and the profile says the stall is dependency wait rather than a schedulable gap, the remaining headroom is in the per-128-K fp32 rescale that co-issues with the MFMA — an axis the frozen pipeline does not expose — so the classic memory/epilogue/graph axes are worth at most one cheap probe each.
- apply: Before budgeting rounds, disassemble to confirm the MFMA is native (an fnuz/ocp naming difference is cosmetic) and count the independent accumulators: with only two per K-scale block, low ILP is intrinsic and re-scheduling cannot recover it.
- verify: Treat a direction as closed only after re-timing on the frozen baseline across all batch cases; several of these read as small wins on one case and regressions on another before the frozen re-time.
- pitfall: Storing the expert weights as fp4 promised a large win but failed the numeric gate at 14-19 dB SNR against a 25 dB threshold → post-MFMA per-block rescale leaves no headroom for a 4-bit mantissa here → a sibling MoE kernel's fp4-weight win did transfer numerically only because it was cosine-gated, not SNR-gated.
- caution: Also verify the scheduler axis is even reachable before spending a round: the fused pipeline header here specializes exactly one scheduler enum and leaves the primary template body empty, so flipping the enum fails the build rather than producing a slower kernel, and the generator exposes no hook for it.
