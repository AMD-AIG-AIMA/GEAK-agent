# Per-bucket tile shape carries an int4-weight MoE grouped GEMM
- lever: Treat each token-count bucket as its own tuning problem, and pay the int4 unpack once per byte instead of once per nibble.
- apply: Load each packed int4 byte once, extract both nibbles by constant shift over the row block and interleave in registers; then per bucket set BLOCK_M (small/medium/large, e.g. 64/256/512), num_warps (4/4/8), matrix_instr_nonkdim=16 on the largest, and gate the software prefetch off for the small-M bucket.
- stack: total ~4.58x isolated = four directions compounded
  - 1. byte-once dual-nibble int4 dequant — 1.82x standalone (verified) — the bulk of the win
  - 2. num_warps 4->8 + matrix_instr_nonkdim=16 — 2.23x on top of (1) (verified)
  - 3. per-bucket BLOCK_M enlargement — 1.80x on top of (1,2), 2.23x -> 4.00x (verified)
  - 4. small-M no-prefetch gate + num_warps re-sweep — 1.13x, tiny-M case only (verified)
  - note: attribution is incremental in landing order, not independent.
- verify: Re-time every bucket against the frozen baseline separately: the large-M gain and the tiny-M gain come from opposite levers, and a geomean hides either one flipping.
- pitfall: num_warps=16 spilled and BLOCK_N=32 regressed → the fp32 [M,64] accumulator VGPR floor is set by the M-side tile, not the N-side → sweep BLOCK_M per bucket and leave BLOCK_N at its default.
  - pitfall: the harness reported IMPROVED=false on rounds that had actually won → report-script false negative → grep the applied-marker and delta yourself and judge the verified geomean against the ~1-2% run-to-run noise floor.
- caution: Also verify the per-element relative-error gate before deferring group scales out of the operand: with signed operands and deep K, one cancelling element blew the gate by ~5 orders of magnitude even in full fp32.
