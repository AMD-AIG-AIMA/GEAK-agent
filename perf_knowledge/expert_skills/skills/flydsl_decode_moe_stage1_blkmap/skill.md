## When to use
Trigger on the **problem signature, not a specific model**: a **grouped-GEMM MoE stage-1 (gate+up)** kernel
at **decode / small-M** where repeated expert-weight HBM traffic is a **material** part of latency (the
baseline may be mixed rather than purely memory-bound), the MoE token-sort pads each expert to a fixed
sort-block granularity `B` (commonly 64 rows), and routing gives many experts **>=2 sort-blocks**. A
per-sort-block compute tile then re-reads the same low-precision expert weight once per block. Do not infer
"compute-bound" merely because the MFMA dispatch dominates wall time, and do not infer "memory-bound" from
analytic bytes alone.

If the workflow has not already distinguished MoE phase/stage, resolve it before applying this skill. Do not
match on `grouped_gemm_moe` alone. This recipe is for the **decode stage-1 gate/up** path: look for the
stage-1 GEMM (`mfma_moe1` / gate-up naming), sorted-block leader mapping, and no top-k reduce kernel in the
scored isolated segment. If the evidence instead points at stage-2 down/reduce (`mfma_moe2`, partial-buffer
materialization, separate top-k reduce), use the stage-2 recipe instead. If phase or stage remains ambiguous,
treat this skill as not applicable and let the normal workflow exploration classify the bottleneck first.

**Three applicability gates — check ALL before claiming the reference-sized win, and report them either way:**
1. **The baseline must select a `tile_m = 64` compute tile.** If the baseline already picks a 128-row tile,
   doubling it needs ~263 KB of LDS against a ~160 KB limit and **will not build**. The recipe is
   inapplicable on that config, not merely unprofitable.
2. **A substantial fraction of sort-blocks must be pairable** (adjacent same-expert pairs). Count them from
   the sorted block->expert table *first*. Report both definitions explicitly: the reference had
   `pair_count_fraction = 86 / 347 = 24.8%` (the analytic weight-read-unit reduction) and
   `paired_block_fraction = 2*86 / 347 = 49.6%` (blocks participating in pairs). A 2%
   `pair_count_fraction` has only a `1/(1-0.02) = 1.020x` traffic-only ceiling before descriptor/resource
   overhead, generally below this skill's own `expects`.
3. **Repeated-weight traffic must be latency-relevant.** Prefer HBM/L2 counters. If counters are unavailable,
   classify the baseline as **mixed / unknown**, run a same-session paired/unpaired ablation, and let measured
   A/B decide; a profiler label with null bandwidth/cache counters is not evidence. After pairing, separately
   check whether the doubled tile shifts the winner to VGPR/LDS residency or MFMA throughput.

Treat baseline config provenance and a clean worktree as hard preflight. The FlyDSL 0.2.2 validation used
the committed `tile_m=64` baseline and measured the honest stage-1 segment at `192.706 -> 174.498 us`
(`1.104x`); a locally edited `tile_m=128` row is a different baseline and invalidates this comparison.

## FlyDSL portability
This recipe requires FlyDSL `>=0.2.2`. The measured evidence below was produced on 0.2.2, but the
transferable content is the pair-fuse/reuse mechanism, not private API names from that release.

On a newer FlyDSL version, inspect the current AITER/FlyDSL implementation, map the same descriptor,
double-height tile, masking, and cache-identity invariants onto the available APIs, then run fresh
compile/parity/A/B to revalidate it. A version difference alone is not a reason to skip the skill, and 0.2.2 performance
numbers must not be reused as evidence for another version.

Compile both the unpaired and paired stage-1 variants in a clean cache, then require the paired runtime
signature (`_am2_bmap` plus one `_blkmap_kernel`) before parity or timing. The **0.2.2 compatibility smoke**
and strict validation on gfx950 used an isolated FlyDSL 0.2.2 wheel. Across three paired full-benchmark
runs (30 samples/run), the stage-1 segment median was `192.706 -> 174.498 us = 1.104x`; median
`logits_diff` was `0.00106816 -> 0.00106673` and cosine was `0.998933 -> 0.998935`.

## Mechanism
Why the redundancy exists: MoE align/sort rounds each expert's token count **up** to the sort-block `B` so the
grouped GEMM can index fixed-size row-blocks; the kernel streams the expert's full weight tile per `B`-row
block. An expert holding `k` sort-blocks therefore reads its weight from HBM `k` times even though the weight
is identical across those blocks. At decode each block is a thin sliver of useful rows, so this redundant
weight read dominates stage-1 HBM traffic.

The lever: **fuse two adjacent same-expert sort-blocks into one `2B`-row compute tile.** The expert weight is
loaded to registers/LDS **once** and MFMA'd against both `B`-row halves, so weight HBM reads for paired experts
are halved (approaching the floor where each expert's weight is read exactly once). The decisive property is
that the **sort-block granularity `B` is left unchanged** — only the stage-1 compute tile's row-height doubles
— so the downstream stage-2 (down) padding and work are identical; the reuse is free of any stage-2 cost. It is
a pure **data-reuse / traffic** optimization: the arithmetic is the same accumulation over a larger `BLOCK_M`,
so the result is numerically equivalent modulo reduction order (not a new numeric scheme).

## Procedure
1. **Establish applicability, not a guessed bottleneck label.** Record base `tile_m`, pair count/fraction,
   VGPR/LDS, and HBM/L2 counters when available. If counters fail, say **mixed / unknown** and use controlled
   same-session A/B. If measured core reduction is much smaller than the analytic weight-read reduction,
   weight traffic is material but not the sole limiter; do not call either arm purely memory- or compute-bound.
2. **Build a compact leader-block descriptor.** Scan the sorted-block -> expert table; for each run of
   same-expert blocks emit `ceil(k/2)` "leader" tiles, each covering two `B`-row sub-blocks (a trailing odd
   block becomes a solo leader covering one). Compute this **device-side and CUDA-graph-safe** — preallocated
   outputs, no host sync, deterministic shapes — so it works under graph capture; an in-kernel parity scan or a
   host-side build is a slower fallback.
3. **Size the leader launch honestly.** `n_leaders = total_blocks - pair_count`; it equals
   `ceil(total_blocks/2)` only when nearly every block pairs. A worst-case full grid with sentinel early exits
   is graph-safe but can add an entire scheduling round when the merged kernel permits only one workgroup/CU.
   Report actual `Grid_Size_Y`; prefer a graph-safe persistent queue, indirect launch, or a producer-integrated
   leader count when the full-grid overhead is material.
4. **In the kernel, set `BLOCK_M = 2B`:** load the expert weight tile once and MFMA it against both `B`-row
   halves; accumulate / run the epilogue exactly as the unpaired kernel does per half.
5. **Store masking (the one correctness-critical step).** A solo leader (odd tail) must mask the store of its
   absent upper half, else it double-writes / goes out of bounds. Carry a per-leader "store-second-half"
   predicate and honor it at the store.
6. **Leave stage-2 (down) on the original `B`-row blocks** — do not widen the sort-block.
7. **Apply a runtime-signature gate before timing.** A valid paired arm must emit the paired GEMM suffix
   (for example `_am2_bmap`) and exactly one descriptor-producer dispatch. If either is absent, the arm is the
   baseline or a plumbing failure — reject its timing. Verify config-selected and forced diagnostic arms emit
   the same signature, then score the config-selected arm with all force-enable environment variables cleared.
8. **Joint-sweep the paired configuration.** `waves_per_eu`, `b_nt`, async-copy/cache policy, and pairing are
   not independently composable winners. Sweep the relevant `w2/w3/w4 x bnt0/bnt2` space with pairing active;
   do not select an unpaired scheduling winner and mechanically stack `_am2` afterward.
9. **Validate parity at the SAME tile granularity as the baseline** (the paired kernel is numerically
   equivalent, so logits must match within reduction-order noise), then measure same-session A/B and confirm
   the weight-HBM-read drop with hardware counters when available. The primary isolated gate is only
   `mfma_moe1 + descriptor`; pre-existing sort/align/quant helpers are diagnostics and the full stage-1 window
   plus whole fused path are secondary transfer metrics.

## Knobs & pitfalls
- **Pairing (merge factor 2) is the validated setting.** Merging `>2` blocks widens `BLOCK_M` further and risks
  LDS / register / occupancy limits — measure before assuming it helps.
- **The validated merged kernel is resource-heavy by design.** About 248 VGPR and 132,096 B LDS for the
  128-row effective tile is an observed reference envelope, not a universal target, and was also seen in the
  hand-tuned implementation. Do not reject it merely for that signature, but account for one-workgroup/CU
  residency and grid scheduling rounds. **Any scratch/spill is a hard rejection** for this validated path.
- **Keep the base sort-block granularity as the baseline uses it.** Forcing the paired (double-height) path on
  top of an already-large base compute tile exceeds the compile-time LDS/register budget and fails to build
  (measured: a 128-row base tile would need ~263 KB LDS against a ~160 KB limit).
- **The descriptor producer must be ONE kernel.** Multiple eager tensor-op dispatches can erase the win.
  The validated fused producer median is **3.158 us**; budget it explicitly against the GEMM saving.
- **Time the producer together with the GEMM.** The producer is a separate dispatch with an unrelated kernel
  name, so a GEMM-name timing filter silently drops it. On the validated 0.2.2 run that would report
  `1.124x` GEMM-only instead of the honest `1.104x` segment. See `expects.isolated_scope`.
- **The win scales with the fraction of `>=2`-block experts.** Synthetic / uniform routing overstates it vs
  skewed real decode routing — report real-routing numbers.
- **Compare against a tuned `tile_m = 128` entry when one exists.** Pairing reaches a `2B`-row compute tile
  from `B`-row sort blocks, while a config that directly sorts at `2B` avoids the descriptor kernel. This
  recipe's value is confined to baselines pinned to `tile_m = B`; never compare a paired arm to a
  differently-tuned denominator.
- **Make the merge factor selectable from the tuner's config, never from an environment variable alone.** In
  the reference the config tag was parsed but then dropped on the way to the kernel, so the tuner could not
  actually select pairing and the path silently never activated — a config-driven arm and an env-forced arm
  must be verified to emit the identical kernel before any A/B is trusted.
- **Every codegen-affecting knob belongs in codegen cache identity.** Include `b_nt`, `a_merge`, `blk_map`, and
  the other scheduling/cache modifiers in both the emitted module name (or an equivalent unique tag) and the
  JIT/AOT cache tuple. Omitting `b_nt`, for example, can make `bnt0` and `bnt2` silently reuse one compiled
  closure and invalidates the sweep.
- **The descriptor producer must be graph-capturable;** a host-side scan defeats CUDA-graph use.

## Do-no-harm notes
- **Numerically equivalent** to the unpaired kernel (same math, larger tile) — but only if the odd-tail store
  mask is correct; a missing mask double-counts. Parity-gate every build.
- **Clearly compute-bound stage-1 (usually prefill / large-M) sees little or no win** and the larger tile can
  cost occupancy. Small-M decode may be mixed: pairing can help before the merged kernel shifts to
  compute/residency limits. The workflow's on-box A/B picks the winner (advisory prior, never overrides
  measurement).
- **The paired mode is a pure add-on** — when not selected the kernel is byte-identical to the generic path, so
  a non-matching shape regresses nothing.

## Sources
- `validation_flydsl_0_2_2.yaml` records the FlyDSL 0.2.2 gfx950 validation: three paired
  full-benchmark runs, 30 samples/run, honest segment median `192.706 -> 174.498 us = 1.104x`.
- Runtime evidence emitted `_am2`/`_am2_bmap` stage-1 work plus one `_blkmap_kernel`, preserved the
  original sort-block granularity, and passed full fused-MoE parity.
- The implementation remains an optional double-height-tile mode; when not selected, the generic path
  is unchanged.
